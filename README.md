###A unified system for managing players, characters, and story assets in SimTerra.

SimRep is intended to model and automate actions that take place behind-the-scenes including:

  - learning skills
  - tracking event attendance
  - purchasing equipment
  - spending time units

This project is fueled by buzzwords, duct tape, and hype.
